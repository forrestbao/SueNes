Task:
Compare sys summa and doc with metric- no reference summary used.

Error:
-> ignore cuda
- Bills issue:-> need to download the data dataset=tfds.load(download=True
- Data storage needed 2TB
- Input output error: install space, download that feature for spacy.
- Raise issue in SueNes regarding Spacy download en_core_web_sm


Once run the code: Bert, runclassifier.sh-> line 14,15 do not want to run. 
Go run_classifier.py-> Two doc t1,t2 and sys summary s=t1 first token in summary,t2…
Std in Bert, concat the token together and add special token [SEP] 
and special token [CLS]- check hugging face library how they did it.
Hugging face transformer course- multiple sequences handling- sequence1_ids 
and 2 is the 2D array. 200 is the special token 
Putting it all together, CLS and SEP- contcat together
Sharing the model on hugging face Hub- so SueNes will update on HuggingFace as model. 
PRE follow GitHub one and (BERT follow huggingface not scenes one).
Where put SueNes-> redo and implement scenes using transformer library.

Use pre folder - generate training data, and use hugging face transformer model to implement it.
SueNes will generate the data and use in our transformer model. 
Then train the generated data.
Use 10% CNNDM as the dataset and use sentence-delete as the only native mutation method

* Step 1: Use the code in pre folder under SueNes repo to generate training data. 
Use 10% of CNNDM as the dataset and sentence-delete as the only mutation method.
* Step 2: Follow the HuggingFace tutorial on transformer to build the SueNes network architecture.
* Step 3: Train the model using code in Step 2 on data generated in Step 1. 
You will need to build a loader yourself to feed training data.
Try finish step1 and 2 done.
